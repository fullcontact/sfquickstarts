## Install the FullContact for Snowflake App
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Duration: 1

The FullContact for Snowflake Native App is available in the Snowlflake Marketplace

1) Visit the "Apps" section of your Snowflake Account - ex where YOURACCOUNTLOCATOR is your own Snowflake Account Locator https://app.snowflake.com/us-east-1/YOURACCOUNTLOCATOR/#/apps/applications

![Install App](assets/installapp.png)

The FullContact for Snowflake Native App is available in the Snowflake Marketplace

1) Visit the "Apps" section of your Snowflake Account - ex where YOURACCOUNTLOCATOR is your own Snowflake Account Locator https://app.snowflake.com/us-east-1/YOURACCOUNTLOCATOR/#/apps/applications

![Install App](assets/installapp.png)

2) Under the "Recently Shared with You" click the "Get" button next to the FullContact Native Identity Application

3) Choose the warehouse to use to run the install scripts (an XS warehouse works fine). 

4) Expand the Options dropdown, where you are able to name the application anything you would like.  We have named the app "FC_NATIVE_APP".  This is the app name we use in the SQL queries we provide post installation of the application in a Snowsight worksheet to help you complete the installation.  

![App options](assets/installoptions.png)

5) Click the Get button to install the application.  The Get button will be deactivated while installing.  There is not currently a loader that displays to give a sense for how the installation is progressing - the installers typically complete within 1-2 minutes.   

6) Once installation is complete, you will see a confirmation modal.  

![Install complete](assets/installcomplete.png)

7) Click the **Open** button, which will open a worksheet pre-populated with the queries you will need to complete the installation.

## Configuring the FullContact for Snowflake App
Duration: 2
>>>>>>> 8857aec (some first mods)

1) Create and grant access to API INTEGRATION

> aside positive
> 
>  The `API INTEGRATION` is used to check your license key, allowed usage, and report usage summary counts back to FullContact. Your raw data never leaves Snowflake as the app executes natively and FullContact will not have access to your raw data unless you decide to share it with us using a normal secure share.

```sql
CREATE API INTEGRATION IF NOT EXISTS FC_API_INT_FULLCONTACT_IDENTITY_SOLUTIONS
    API_PROVIDER = aws_api_gateway
    API_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::966965295085:role/cx-blizzard-snowflake'
    API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES = ('https://um58694ui8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blizzard-default/v3')
    ENABLED = true;

-- Grant access to allow a specific user or role to use this application
GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION FC_API_INT_FULLCONTACT_IDENTITY_SOLUTIONS TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP;
GRANT APPLICATION ROLE FC_NATIVE_APP.FC_USER TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
```

2) Install and define the `EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS` that the application needs to run. 

```sql
-- Install the EFs (external functions) that the app needs to run:
-- install EFs
CALL FC_NATIVE_APP.APP_SCHEMA.CREATE_EF_GET_DATAPACKS('FC_API_INT_FULLCONTACT_IDENTITY_SOLUTIONS');
CALL FC_NATIVE_APP.APP_SCHEMA.CREATE_EF_GET_OAUTH_GROUP_LIST('FC_API_INT_FULLCONTACT_IDENTITY_SOLUTIONS');
CALL FC_NATIVE_APP.APP_SCHEMA.CREATE_EF_GET_OAUTH_GROUP_MEMBER_LIST('FC_API_INT_FULLCONTACT_IDENTITY_SOLUTIONS');
CALL FC_NATIVE_APP.APP_SCHEMA.CREATE_EF_GET_PRODUCT_USAGE('FC_API_INT_FULLCONTACT_IDENTITY_SOLUTIONS');
CALL FC_NATIVE_APP.APP_SCHEMA.CREATE_EF_PUT_USAGE('FC_API_INT_FULLCONTACT_IDENTITY_SOLUTIONS');
```

In order to use the FullContact for Snowflake Application you need a license (API) key. Follow these instructions to get one for free and use the generated key in the next sections.

1) Visit the [FullContact for Snowflake Offer Page](https://platform.fullcontact.com/register/offer/snowresolve)

![Platform Offer](assets/platformoffer.png)

2) Enter your business email address and click "Create Account". Once complete you should see a page directing you to check your email.

![Platform Signup](assets/signupbutton.png)

3) Check your email to find a "Welcome to FullContact" email. Click the "Verify This Email Address" button to setup your initial password

![Verify Email](assets/verifyemail.png)

4) Choose your new Password and complete the short "Tell Us About Your Business Form"

5) Once the form is complete you will be logged into the FullContact Platform. Click the "API Keys" menu option on the left hand side.

![API Keys](assets/apikeys.png)

6) Click the "+ Generate API Key" button, verify your phone number via SMS then name your key (we used `Snowflake Key` in this example)

![Name Key](assets/namekey.png)

7) Click the copy button to copy the value of the key into a secure location for the next step (a notepad or file would work)

## Prepping the Input Data
Duration: 1

Before we can run Resolve to unify the sample customer data we need to setup a database and schema to hold the output tables and need to create a SEMANTIC VIEW to help the FullContact application understand how to interpret the different columns in the data. 

Follow the steps below and copy and paste the SQL to your SQL Worksheet.

1) Create output schema

```sql
CREATE DATABASE FC_QUICKSTART;
CREATE SCHEMA FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT;

GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE FC_QUICKSTART TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP;
```

2) Create the Semantic Input view. Run the following stored procedure. It will scan the sample input dataset and output additional SQL that you will need to copy/paste/run into your worksheet. 

```sql
CALL FC_NATIVE_APP.APP_SCHEMA.CREATE_INPUT_VIEW(
'FC_NATIVE_APP.SAMPLE_DATA.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_DEMO', -- input table name
'FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC',  -- output view name
'EMAIL_1',                                              -- name of column to treat as RECORD_ID
['HEM', 'MAID']);                                       -- type of data we plan on enriching with
```

3) Copy the results of the previous SPROC and run it (it should be something similar to the below)

```sql
-- This view create statement contains predicted aliases for columns based on data in each column.
-- Please review the statement and modify it as needed before using it as input to the RESOLVE stored procedure.
-- Accepted column names for the RESOLVE stored procedure can be found in the documentation.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC AS SELECT
	EMAIL_1 AS RECORD_ID,
	FIRST_NAME,
	LAST_NAME,
	RECORD_ID,
	CITY,
	PURCHASE_CHANNEL,
	ZIP_CODE,
	ADDRESS_LINE_1,
	PHONE_NUMBER,
	ADDRESS_LINE_2,
	CUSTOMER_NUMBER,
	LIFETIME_VALUE,
	EMAIL_1,
	STATE
FROM DEV.APP_SAMPLE_DATA.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_DEMO;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE FC_QUICKSTART TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS LIKE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC;
ALTER TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS ADD COLUMN PIDS ARRAY;
ALTER TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS ADD COLUMN RESOLVE_RUN_ID VARCHAR;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE FC_QUICKSTART TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT INSERT ON TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT DELETE ON TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS LIKE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS;
ALTER TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS ADD COLUMN PID VARCHAR;
ALTER TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS ADD COLUMN ENRICH_RUN_ID VARCHAR;
ALTER TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS ADD COLUMN EMAILS VARIANT;
ALTER TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS ADD COLUMN MAIDS VARIANT;

GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE FC_QUICKSTART TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT INSERT ON TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
GRANT DELETE ON TABLE FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS TO APPLICATION FC_NATIVE_APP_DEV;
```

At this point you should have your SEMANTIC view `FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC` created as well as two empty output tables that will be populated in the next step: `FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS` and `FC_QUICKSTART.OUTPUT.CUST_JOURNEY_PURCHASE_SEMANTIC_RESOLVE_RESULTS_ENRICH_RESULTS`
